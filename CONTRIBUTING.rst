Contributing Guidelines
=======================

See `contribution-guide.org`_ for the basics on contributing
to an open source project.

The content in this repository is licensed `CC-BY-SA-4.0`_.
By contributing, you grant this project and its members the right
to publish your contribution under the terms of that license.


.. _issue-reporting:

Reporting an Error, or Requesting an Addition
---------------------------------------------

Any corrections and change requests are managed using GitHub's `issue tracker`_.
If you never opened an issue on GitHub before, consult the
`Mastering Issues`_ guide.


.. _pull-requests:

Adding Your Own Contributions
-----------------------------

The handbook is rendered to HTML using the `Sphinx tool`_,
the text itself is written using `reStructuredText markup`_.

The easiest way to edit text is using GitHub's `built-in editor`_.
When you click the edit button (pencil), it will fork the project
for you and then open the rich-text web editor.
It is very **convenient to fix small spelling or grammatical errors**
on the fly, while you're reading the handbook.

If you're reading this on *Read the Docs*, take note of the *“Edit on GitHub”*
button in the top-right corner of each page, which will take you to the
under-lying text file on GitHub.

The GitHub editor has a `Preview` button (use it) and can save directly
into a so-called ‘pull request’ (PR) for integration into the project.
Please do *not* save changes into a PR just to “try it out”,
you can however save changes into your fork at your pleasure.

The **more technical but also more powerful way** is to clone the
project to your machine.
Here are some resources to help you with getting started,
if you never wrote anything for a ``Sphinx`` document before:

* the `Sphinx reStructuredText Primer`_ explains the text markup language used.
* the `project's README`_ shows you how to build the handbook on your own machine.

After you wrote, spell-checked and reviewed your text, `open a pull request`_
as explained in the `GitHub help`_.
Try to keep PRs at a reasonable size, ideally only changing one file,
especially when it comes to the command reference.
This reduces the potential of merge conflicts and rework,
and also makes reviews take a manageable amount of time.
